## This is a platform, which bridges NGOs and philanthropists who are working towards eradicating poverty. This project holds the potential for profound societal impact. By facilitating direct and efficient collaboration, we ensure that resources are allocated to where they are needed most. This synergy directly aligns with the United Nations' first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) to end poverty in all its forms. By enhancing transparency, accountability, and the efficient use of resources, our platform not only empowers NGOs to amplify their efforts but also enables philanthropists to make informed, impactful contributions, fostering sustainable development and improving the lives of the most vulnerable communities.



## What are Sustainable Development Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015, aimed at addressing various social, economic, and environmental challenges by 2030. These goals promote a sustainable future by eradicating poverty, reducing inequality, improving health and education, ensuring environmental protection, fostering economic growth, and promoting peace and justice. Each goal has specific targets and indicators to track progress, encouraging global collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society to create a better world for current and future generations.

### SDG -1 : No Poverty
The first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-1) is "No Poverty", which aims to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce poverty in all its forms worldwide. This goal focuses on ensuring that all people, especially the most vulnerable, have access to basic resources like food, shelter, healthcare, and education. It promotes equal access to economic opportunities, social protection systems, and measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and other shocks. The overarching aim is to eliminate extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, by 2030.


## Working of the platform:
Imapct Bridge is a Java based web application. The frontend is made using React js, Mongodb is used to store the data and Java API keys are used to connect the frontend and the backend.
1. NGOs and philanthropists register themselves with us. NGOs list the projects they want to accomplish. 
2. The projects are displayed to the philanthropists and they choose which project(s) to fund. 
3. Donation history on NGO side displays the amount they have received so far from different philanthropists and the donation history on the philanthropist side displays the amount they have to donated so far to different NGOs. The data of both NGOs and philanthropists is stored securely in Mongo DB. 
4. The frontend connects with the database using Java API keys (Spring Boot).
